Create GDAY driving files for Australia using the AWAP data.


AWAP data is daily gridded rainfall, temperature,
vapour pressure and solar irradiance surfaces at 0.05 degree spatial
resolution from the Bureau of Meteorology’s Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP; http://www.eoc.csiro.au/awap/) data set (Grant et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2009). 

Further details are found in C1 of Haverd et al. (2013) Multiple observation types reduce uncertainty in Australia’s terrestrial carbon and water cycles. Biogeosciences, 10, 2011–2040. http://www.biogeosciences.net/10/2011/2013/bg-10-2011-2013.pdf

Data is stored on the NCI in /g/data1/fj2/AWAP

* Rad: 1990-2013   (MJ m-2)
* Rain: 1900-2011  (mm)
* Tmax: 1900-2011  (deg C)
* Tmin: 1950-2013  (deg C)
* vph09: 1950-2013 (hPa)
* vph15: 1950-2013 (hPa)

Daily vapour pressure observations are instantaneous at 0900h and 1500h, so hourly estimates for vapour pressure are generated by linear interpolation between 1500h the previous day, 0900h and 1500h the current day, and 0900h the next day. 

There is no wind data, one potential climatology could come from http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/08/53A0E131E9171. In Vanessa's paper they assumed a fixed value of 3 m s-1 (daylight).

Atmospheric pressure is assumed to be 1000 mb.

As there is no matching PAR before 1990, Vanessa used a climatology based on what data there is (1990-2013), i.e. every day in Jan was the same.

Soil information was from McKensize and Hook '92, Mckenzie 2000, Digital atlas of Australian soils.
